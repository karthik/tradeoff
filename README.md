# Life-history tradeoff analysis

author: Karthik Ram, [karthik.ram@gmail.com](mailto:karthik.ram@gmail.com)

This repository contains all the code for my paper on life history trade off analysis. I'll flesh this README more shortly but for the time being, here is the organizational set up:

```
td1 (growth rate versus juvenile survival)
	|_analysis
	|_results
	|_viz (visualization)

td2 (adult survival versus fecundity)
	|_analysis
	|_results
	|_viz (visualization)

td1 (growth rate versus fecundity)
	|_analysis
	|_results
	|_viz (visualization)
```
Each trade off folder has a more detailed README.
