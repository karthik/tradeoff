# Literature survey (contd)
---

# Review of remaining papers in my literature search

# Papers that use models with individual heterogeneity and look at how it impacts life history optimization under a tradeoff.

# Papers that set up simple stage-structured matrix models similar to the 2x2 matrix that is our jumping-off-point.

> The paper I was trying to recall that shows the Price equation for stage-structured matrix models is Barfield et al. in Am Nat. I noted this in the comments I made on the bib file you sent, which I emailed back yesterday. So please be sure to go over the comments I provided there.

Look for papers by Benton T G.
%% THESE GUYS DO GREAT WORK. WE SHOULD LOOK TO SEE IF THEIR MODELS FOR
ITEROPARITY ARE SET UP AS MATRIX MODELS.  WE SHOULD LOOK AT THE ORZACK
AND TULJAPURKAR CASES THEY REFER TO SPECIFICALLY TO SEE IF THEY USE A
MATRIX MODEL FOR ITEROPARITY QUESTIONS.  WE CAN SAY SOMETHING LIKE
"PEOPLE HAVE LOOKED A LOT AT THE IMPACT OF ENVIRONMENTAL STOCHASTICITY
ON LIFE-HISTORY EVOLUTION, BUT LESS AT THE IMPACT OF INDIVIDUAL
HETEROGENEITY."

I should add this paper to the list:
