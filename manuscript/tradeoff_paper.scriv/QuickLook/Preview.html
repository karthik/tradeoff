<p class="binderItem"><strong>Introduction</strong><br/>Classic life-history theory predicts that organisms experience tradeoffs in traits such as juveline growth and survival, adult survival and fecundity, and juveline survival and fecundity. Predictions from simple density-independent demographic models suggest that these tradeoffs result in an optimim where growth rate is maximum.<br/>
Ecologists, however, have been aware for well over fifty years that this suite of models are overly simplistic. For example, in a simple matrix model, there is a single ...</p>

We find that incorporating variation in juveline devleopment lowers the optimal growth rate for a tradeoff. Further, adding correlation among stages, on in the case of this exercise, between stages, lowered the arg max for tradeof. This suggest that incorporating some level of realism has a significant effects on the outcome of the tradeoff.<br/>
<br/>
In the case of the tradeoff between juveline survival and growth rate, for most parameter combinations, we were unable to obtain any tradeoff — I....</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Discussion</strong><br/>Although ecologists have been well aware of the existence of individual heterogeneity, especially within groups of seemingly identical individuals, such grouping can still do a poor job of capturing the inherent variation. In this paper we demonstrate how the consideration of individual variation in classic life-history tradeoffs can result in dramatically different outcomes of trade-offs.</p>

Dear EIC,<br/>
Please consider our manuscript titled “Variation in cohort development time and correlation among life history stages alter outcome of classic ecological tradeoffs”.  Ecologists have long been aware that variation among individuals in a cohort can impact the dynamics of stage structured models yet choose unrealistic assumptions for the sake of tractability. While there are many approaches to incorporate more reali...</p>
