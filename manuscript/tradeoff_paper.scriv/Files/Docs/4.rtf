\f0\fs26 \cf2 Classic life-history theory predicts that organisms experience tradeoffs in traits such as juveline growth and survival, adult survival and fecundity, and juveline survival and fecundity. Predictions from simple density-independent demographic models suggest that these tradeoffs result in an optimim where growth rate is maximum.\
Ecologists, however, have been aware for well over fifty years that this suite of models are overly simplistic. For example, in a simple matrix model, there is a single flow rate between life-history stages although it is widely acknolwdged that there is variation in development time among individuals within any given stage. Explicitly modeling individual variation can result in the model becoming far too complex, likely accomplished through the use of delay difference equations. }
