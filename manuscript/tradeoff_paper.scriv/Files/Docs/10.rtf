We find that incorporating variation in juveline devleopment lowers the optimal growth rate for a tradeoff. Further, adding correlation among stages, on in the case of this exercise, between stages, lowered the arg max for tradeof. This suggest that incorporating some level of realism has a significant effects on the outcome of the tradeoff.\
\
In the case of the tradeoff between juveline survival and growth rate, for most parameter combinations, we were unable to obtain any tradeoff \'97 I.e. Avoid the boundary condition altogether.  Thus, we eliminated cases where there was no tradeoff. \
